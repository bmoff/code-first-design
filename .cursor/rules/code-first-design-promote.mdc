# Promoting components

**Before you start:** Read `code-first-design.mdc` to understand how the framework works, especially the "Draft vs production" and "Components vs prototypes" sections.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** 
- You promote **components**, not prototypes. Prototypes stay in `/proto` for ongoing experimentation.
- If you have components within a prototype that you want to use in production, promote those individual components.
- Confirm which component to promote before starting. Ask: "Which component should I promote to production?" Only proceed once you have a clear answer.

## Steps

1) Move `components/draft/<Name>.tsx` → `components/<Name>.tsx` (or feature folder).

2) Update imports in any demos and registries.

3) In `app/proto/_ds/registry.ts`, move entry to `customComponents`.

4) If the demo config is no longer needed, remove it from `component-registry.ts`.

5) Run:
   - `npm run validate-components`
   - `npm run validate:demos`
