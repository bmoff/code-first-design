# Promoting components

1) Move `components/draft/<Name>.tsx` → `components/<Name>.tsx` (or feature folder).

2) Update imports in any demos and registries.

3) In `app/proto/_ds/registry.ts`, move entry to `customComponents`.

4) If the demo config is no longer needed, remove it from `component-registry.ts`.

5) Run:
   - `npm run validate-components`
   - `npm run validate:demos`
