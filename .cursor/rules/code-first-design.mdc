# Code-First-Design Framework

This project uses Code-First-Design, a framework for managing UI components with a clear separation between draft (experimental) and production components.

## How it works

The framework uses three registries that work together:

1. **`app/proto/_ds/registry.ts`** - Lists all components with metadata (name, path, category). Used for navigation on the `/proto` landing page.

2. **`app/proto/_ds/component-registry.ts`** - Imports component code and defines default props. Used for validation and safe rendering with fallback behaviour.

3. **`app/proto/components/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Contains the `COMPONENT_DEMOS` object that maps component slugs to React render functions. This renders the component previews at `/proto/components/<kebab-name>`.

## Components vs prototypes

**Components** are individual UI pieces:
- Have a `file` property in the registry
- Rendered via `COMPONENT_DEMOS` in `app/proto/components/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Need all three registries updated (`registry.ts`, `component-registry.ts`, `COMPONENT_DEMOS`)

**Prototypes** are full application flows:
- No `file` property (just routes)
- Live at `app/proto/prototypes/[name]/page.tsx`
- Registered in `registry.ts` only (not `component-registry.ts` or `COMPONENT_DEMOS`)
- Can import draft components freely
- Can have nested routes

## Draft vs production

- **Draft components** live in `components/draft/` and can only be imported in `/proto` routes. ESLint blocks their use in production code.
- **Production components** live in `components/` (or feature folders) and can be used anywhere.
- Promoting a component means moving it from `draft/` to production and updating all three registries.

## Conventions

- **Component naming**: PascalCase for custom components (`ExampleCard.tsx`), kebab-case for shadcn primitives (`button.tsx`).
- **Default props**: All draft components should export `defaultProps` for demo rendering.
- **Server Components**: Prefer Server Components; add `'use client'` only when required.
- **Composition**: Compose from `components/ui/*` (shadcn primitives) where possible.

## Registering UI Primitives

UI primitives (shadcn/ui components in `components/ui/*`) can be registered in the design system if you want them to appear in the design system UI:

1. Add to `app/proto/_ds/registry.ts` under `uiPrimitives`:
   ```ts
   uiPrimitives: [
     { name: "Button", path: "/proto/components/button", file: "components/ui/button.tsx" },
   ]
   ```

2. Add to `app/proto/_ds/component-registry.ts` (if you want validation/demos)

3. Add to `app/proto/components/[slug]/page.tsx` `COMPONENT_DEMOS` (if you want interactive demos)

Note: UI primitives don't need to be registered - they're already production-ready. Registration is optional and only needed if you want them to appear in the design system showcase.

## Workflows

- **Creating draft components or prototypes**: Follow `code-first-design-create.mdc` (handles both, includes planning questions for prototypes)
- **Promoting to production**: Follow `code-first-design-promote.mdc`
- **Design patterns**: Follow `design.mdc`

## Validation

Run validation scripts after creating or promoting components:
- `npm run validate-components` - Ensures all components can be imported and rendered
- `npm run validate:demos` - Checks that every component in the registry has a working demo
